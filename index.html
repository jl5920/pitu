        Pitu was born on September 18, 2015; her arrival has been a blessing for the entire family.
    </h3>

    Pitu spends lots of time with her family members. She is a very loveable girl with a natural ability to make you
    feel good. She loves to visit her <a href="images/grandma.jpeg" title="Picture of Mama Caimen"

    <br>
    Her favorite person among the entire family is her <a href="images/tia.JPG" title="Picture of tia Yanira"

    will spend time with her aunt.

    Other family members that she is very fond of is her sister <a href="images/bea.jpeg" title="Picture of sister Bea"
